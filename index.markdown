**Water.** I've worked with [Public Lab](http://publiclab.org), the [University of Los Andes](http://www.uniandes.edu.co/), the [MIT Center for Civic Media](https://civic.mit.edu/), [West Virginia State University](https://civic.mit.edu/), [Walker Environmental Research](http://walkerenvres.com/), [Emerson College](http://www.emerson.edu), the [Ocean Exploration Trust](http://nautiluslive.org), and others to develop and assess free and open source prototypes, reference designs, and data workflows for water monitoring applications. Much of this work is archived [here](https://github.com/openwaterproject).

**Agroecology.** I've collaborated with [FarmHack](http://farmhack.org), [The Food Project](http://thefoodproject.org) and [Wolfes Neck Farm](http://wolfesneckfarm.org/) on several projects focused on infrastructure and resource analysis for both urban and rural farming contexts.  Some of that work is documented in the Pioneer Valley Open Science [github repository](https://github.com/p-v-o-s).
