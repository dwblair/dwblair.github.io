<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kleiner and Bauwens <a href="https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/michel-bauwens-on-the-pitfalls-of-start-up-culture-2/2017/09/20">point to the need for transvestment</a>, and propose a <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License">Peer Production License</a>.</li>
<li>This would require sharing information <em>selectively</em> with 'blessed' individual or organizations (Peers). This seems prima facie counter to the notion that 'useful information wants to be free'.</li>
<li>But, Kleiner has elsewhere made the point: privacy is necessary in order to achieve true consent when sharing. If you don't have the ability to withold consent, then you can't truly give consent.</li>
<li>The same values and infrastructure that would uphold this perceived right to Privacy -- the ability to decide with whom one shares one's information -- seem, then, at least potentially consistent with the dynamics of sharing in a Peer Production Licensing context, in which information is shared only with Peers.</li>
<li>Selectively sharing useful information with particular Peers seems like it could be consistent with the same values and practices that support the maintenance of Privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-dat-protocol-secure-content-addressing-for-file-sharing">The DAT protocol: secure content addressing for file sharing</h2>
<ul>
<li>The DAT protocol provides a secure 'hash'-based content-addressing system for file storage.</li>
<li>Every file is assigned a unique identifier that is a function of its contents. This identifier is difficult to guess without knowing the contents of the file.</li>
<li>Any change or addition to the file results in a different hash address for the file.</li>
<li>Thus, every new 'version' of a file will have a new, difficult-to-guess, effectively-unique identifier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proposal-peer-production-licensing-via-dat">Proposal: Peer Production Licensing, via DAT</h2>
<ul>
<li>A commons-oriented individual or organization (the 'Publisher') might decide to share a set of files with particular Peers, using the DAT protocol.</li>
<li>The licensing might be something like: &quot;Free for education, non-commercial, and commons-oriented uses.&quot;</li>
<li>The definition of 'commons-oriented' would be at the discretion of the Publisher.</li>
<li>The Publisher uses the criterion of 'commons-oriented' to decide whether or not some entity (individual, organization) qualifies as a Peer.</li>
<li>Every new version of a file would necessarily have a new DAT address (because: content addressing).</li>
<li>When creating a new version of a file, the Publisher only shares the resultant new address with Peers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenge-controlling-the-flow-of-information">Challenge: controlling the flow of information</h2>
<p>It seems technically challenging, in an era in which the marginal cost of sharing information is approaching zero, to prevent the unauthorized sharing of information by Peers with Non-Peers. Once a data file is available to a Peer, what is to prevent that Peer from sharing information with Non-Peers -- using the DAT or other protocols?</p>
<h3 id="traceablity-as-a-solution">Traceablity as a solution?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Publisher might include an 'address' in a shared file that references a particular Peer -- adding to the file a secret key, only shared with that Peer.</li>
<li>Then, if any DAT file Published by the author is found in the hands of a Non-Peer, its origin could be traced to the Peer who shared it in an unauthorized way.</li>
<li>This still doesn't prevent unauthorized sharing of files via other, non-traceable means.</li>
<li>But at least this would indur an extra computational cost on the part of Peers who attempt to share information with Non-Peers.</li>
</ul>
